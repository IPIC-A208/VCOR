# VCOR: A Video Compression Framework Using an Overfitted Restoration Neural Network


Our video compression framework called VCOR which combine a conventional codec and a overfitted restoration neural network.

Our network structure is illustrated as follow.

## Experiment process
The experiment is divided into two processes, conventional encode and overfitted restoration.
### conventional encode
We tried five conventional codec, including HM, x264, x265, NVENC, VTM. The conventional encoded bitstream and decoder are in folder data. We can decode these bitstream to get reconstruction data.
```
ffmpeg -i Output.h264 -pix fmt yuv420p Rec.yuv
```

### Overfitted restoration
Open folder code and run the command like follow to restore reconstruction video.
```
python train.py --lr 0.001 --qp 37 --decay 30 --epoch 70 --frame 600 --batch_size 64 --width_cut 60 --heigh_cut 60 --width 1280 --heigh 720 --data HM --sequence Johnny_1280x720_60
```
